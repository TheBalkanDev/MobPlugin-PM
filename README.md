# MobPlugin-PM

A fork of jasonwynn10ˋs [VanillaEntityAI](https://github.com/jasonwynn10/VanillaEntityAI) Plugin.

Similar to the [Mob Plugin](https://github.com/Nukkit-coders/MobPlugin) for NukkitX.

## It donˋt work!
• Yeah, this Plugin is very hard to fix, because it works with very complicate algorithms and Packets.
• I do my best to fix it. If you want open an pull-request!
• I will add new stuff when it's completely fixed!

## About
With this plugin, mobs spawn almost exactly like they do in vanilla! Using custom algorithms and tracking AI, this plugin makes the server-mob experience as close as possible, while still keeping the server lag-free!
